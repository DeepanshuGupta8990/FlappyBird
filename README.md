# FlappyBird - https://64b3ab9cbd75e91576defa64--visionary-mermaid-87aaec.netlify.app/

This is a simple implementation of the popular game Flappy Bird using vanilla JavaScript. The game allows the player to control a bird's flight by using the spacebar key to make it fly through a series of pipes.

Getting Started
To run the Flappy Bird game on your local machine, follow the instructions below:

Clone this repository or download the source code as a ZIP file.
Extract the contents of the ZIP file (if downloaded) to a local directory of your choice.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Game Controls
Press the spacebar key to make the bird fly. The longer you hold the spacebar, the higher the bird will fly.
The bird automatically descends when you release the spacebar.
Avoid colliding with the pipes. If the bird hits a pipe or the ground, the game is over.
The game automatically restarts when it's over.
Game Development Details
The Flappy Bird game was developed using the following technologies and concepts:

HTML5 Canvas: The game graphics are rendered on an HTML5 canvas element.
Vanilla JavaScript: The game logic and interactivity were implemented using pure JavaScript, without relying on any external libraries.
Event Listeners: The game listens for user input by registering event listeners for key presses.
Game Loop: A game loop is implemented to update the game state and redraw the canvas continuously.
Collision Detection: The game checks for collisions between the bird and the pipes or the ground to determine if the game is over.
Scoring: The player earns a point for each successfully passed pipe.
